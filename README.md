# Biological-Sequences-Dot-Plot

### Overview
This application allows users to input two DNA sequences and displays a dot matrix of these sequences.

Dot matrix analysis is one approach to comparing biological sequences. Dot matrix analysis works by aligning two input sequences on axes and placing dots wherever matches of symbols (i.e. DNA bases) are found. Although this approach relies on human visual analysis and does not have mathematical rigour, a dot matrix analysis can give us a clue about the existence of potential sequence alignments. Hence, it is oftentimes applied prior to sequence alignment algorithms. 

### Installation
To run this application, you need to install Python together with two additional libraries: Biopython and Matplotlib. The detail of these packages, including how to install them, can be found [here](http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython) and [here](https://matplotlib.org/index.html).
